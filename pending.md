# Enhanced Compare Mode - Pending Tasks

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1**: Database Schema Enhancement - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 2**: API Layer Enhancement - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 3**: UI Architecture Transformation - COMPLETED

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 4: Compare Mode State Management - **IN PROGRESS**

_Duration: 2-3 days_

#### 4.1 Enhanced State Management

- [ ] Upgrade `useCompareMode` hook for persistent compare state
- [ ] Add model-specific message arrays in state
- [ ] Implement "Continue with single model" logic with proper state transitions
- [ ] Add token usage tracking in real-time during streaming

#### 4.2 Chat History Integration

- [ ] Update sidebar to show compare mode indicators (🔍 icon)
- [ ] Modify `getChatHistory` to include compare mode metadata
- [ ] Add filtering options for compare vs single mode chats
- [ ] Ensure proper loading of compare mode chats when reopened

---

### Phase 5: Follow-up & Continuation Logic

_Duration: 2-3 days_

#### 5.1 Follow-up Message Handling

- [ ] Route new messages to all active models in compare mode
- [ ] Append responses to respective model columns
- [ ] Maintain conversation context per model
- [ ] Handle model-specific errors gracefully

#### 5.2 Single Model Continuation

- [ ] Add "Continue with this model" buttons in each column
- [ ] Update chat mode from compare to single with proper state management
- [ ] Preserve message history with proper model attribution
- [ ] Stop routing to inactive models after continuation choice

---

### Phase 6: Token Usage & Resource Management

_Duration: 1-2 days_

#### 6.1 Token Tracking Implementation

- [ ] Add real-time token counters in column headers
- [ ] Implement session-level token usage display
- [ ] Add cost estimation based on model pricing
- [ ] Create usage alerts for high consumption

#### 6.2 Resource Optimization

- [ ] Implement intelligent caching for model responses
- [ ] Add request throttling to prevent abuse
- [ ] Create usage analytics for admin monitoring
- [ ] Optimize parallel streaming performance

---

### Phase 7: Responsive Design & Polish

_Duration: 1-2 days_

#### 7.1 Mobile Optimization

- [ ] Stack columns vertically on mobile devices
- [ ] Add swipe gestures for column navigation
- [ ] Optimize touch targets for mobile interactions
- [ ] Ensure proper scroll behavior on small screens

#### 7.2 UX Polish

- [ ] Add loading states for each column
- [ ] Implement smooth animations for mode transitions
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Create onboarding tooltips for new users

---

### Phase 8: Testing & Quality Assurance

_Duration: 1-2 days_

#### 8.1 Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for new database functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for compare mode workflows
- [ ] Performance testing for parallel requests

#### 8.2 Migration & Deployment

- [ ] Database migration scripts with rollback capability
- [ ] Feature flag implementation for gradual rollout
- [ ] Performance monitoring for production deployment
- [ ] Documentation updates for new features

---

## Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

### Immediate Fixes Needed

- [ ] Improve type safety for Messages component props in compare view
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for compare mode failures
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup on component unmount
- [ ] Add loading states during compare mode initialization

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add ability to compare responses across different prompts
- [ ] Implement model performance analytics
- [ ] Add export functionality for comparison results
- [ ] Create templates for common comparison scenarios

## Expected Outcomes After Completion

After implementing all pending phases, users will be able to:

1. **Start compare mode** from any point in a conversation or from existing chats
2. **View side-by-side responses** in a horizontal scrollable layout with full mobile support
3. **Send follow-up messages** to all models simultaneously with maintained context
4. **Monitor token usage** per model in real-time with cost estimates
5. **Continue with a single model** at any point without losing conversation history
6. **Access compare mode chats** from sidebar with special indicators and filtering
7. **Use on all devices** with optimized responsive design
8. **Track usage and performance** with comprehensive analytics
