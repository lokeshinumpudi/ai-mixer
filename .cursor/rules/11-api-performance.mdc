# 11: API Performance & Optimization

## Core Principle: Data Consolidation

To minimize network requests and improve frontend performance, related data is consolidated into single API endpoints.

### ✅ Preferred Pattern: Consolidated API

Instead of multiple fetches for models and user settings, the application uses a single endpoint.

```typescript
// ✅ PREFER: Single, consolidated API call
const { models, userSettings, userType } = useModels(); // Hits /api/models once

// ❌ AVOID: Multiple separate API calls
const { data: models } = useSWR("/api/models", fetcher);
const { data: userSettings } = useSWR("/api/user/settings", fetcher);
```

The `/api/models` endpoint fetches all necessary data in parallel on the server-side, reducing client-side waterfalls.

## Streamlined Upgrade Flow

The user upgrade flow has been optimized by removing the intermediate `/pricing` page. All "Upgrade" CTAs now link directly to the Razorpay payment page, reducing user friction and simplifying the funnel.

Note: Some code paths still reference `/api/models/public` as a protected endpoint for broader model discovery. Keep consolidated data on `/api/models` authoritative for client state.

## Caching Strategy

### Multi-Level Caching Architecture

1. **Database Cache**: For expensive external APIs (Vercel Gateway) - 7-day expiry, daily refresh
2. **SWR Cache**: For API responses - configurable TTL based on data volatility
3. **Memory Cache**: For frequently accessed data - session-based, immediate expiry

### Database Caching Pattern

```typescript
// For stable external data (model info, pricing)
const { data: cache } = await supabase
  .from("model_cache")
  .select("models")
  .gt("expiresAt", new Date().toISOString())
  .single();

if (cache) {
  return NextResponse.json({ models: cache.models }); // ~50ms response
}

// Fallback to live API only if cache miss
const { models } = await gateway.getAvailableModels();
return NextResponse.json({ models }); // ~1200ms response
```

### SWR Configuration

SWR is configured with appropriate caching strategies to reduce redundant requests:

- **`revalidateOnFocus: false`**: Prevents excessive refetching when users switch tabs.
- **`dedupingInterval`**: Prevents identical requests from being sent in a short period.
- **`refreshInterval`**: Periodically refetches data like model availability in the background.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid creating hooks that depend on each other in a circular fashion.
- **Over-Consolidation**: Do not group logically unrelated data into a single endpoint. The data in a consolidated API should be cohesive (e.g., everything needed to render the chat view).
