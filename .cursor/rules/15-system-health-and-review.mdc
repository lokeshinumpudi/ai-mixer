# 15: System Health & Review

## Overview

This is a living document that captures findings from architecture reviews, summarizes recent progress, and outlines a roadmap for future improvements.

## Architecture Review Findings (as of latest review)

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- **Authentication**: Robust Supabase integration with type-safe decorators.
- **Database**: Strong data integrity with centralized, type-safe queries.
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation and user-scoped data access.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

- **OAuth Identity Management**: **CRITICAL** - The initial "Supabase ID as Primary Key" approach was dangerous and would cause massive data loss. Now uses SAFE linking approach that preserves all relationships.
- **Schema-Reality Mismatch**: The `user` table schema uses `defaultRandom()` for anonymous users but Supabase ID for OAuth users. This is intentional for the linking approach.
- **Inconsistent User ID Types**: Some legacy tables use `varchar` for `userId` while newer ones use `uuid`. This should be standardized to `uuid`.
- **Query Optimization**: Some high-traffic queries could benefit from composite indexes.

## Summary of Recent Progress

### UI/UX Overhaul

- **Model Picker**: Redesigned from a grid to a content-first vertical list, improving scannability and mobile experience.
- **Settings Page**: Layout optimized to prioritize usage tracking and a clear upgrade CTA for free users.
- **Upgrade Flow**: Streamlined by removing the intermediate `/pricing` page, linking CTAs directly to the payment gateway to reduce friction.

### Technical Optimizations

- **API Performance**: Consolidated `/api/models` and `/api/user/settings` into a single endpoint, reducing network requests by ~50% on page load.
- **Anonymous User Handling**: Fixed bugs related to rate limiting and data persistence for anonymous users, and resolved a privacy issue where chat history could leak between sessions.
- **Route Simplification**: The route configuration was simplified from a three-tier (public, protected, conditional) to a two-tier (public, protected) system, reducing cognitive overhead.

### Critical Security & Data Integrity Fixes

#### OAuth Identity Management Overhaul üö®

**ISSUE DISCOVERED**: The initial "Supabase ID as Primary Key" approach was **catastrophically dangerous** and would cause massive data loss.

**RISKS IDENTIFIED**:

- **Data Loss**: Overwriting user IDs would orphan all chats, messages, payments, and related data
- **Foreign Key Violations**: Future tables would have broken relationships
- **Recovery Impossible**: Once IDs are overwritten, data relationships cannot be restored
- **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions during ID changes

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:

- ‚úÖ **SAFE Linking Approach**: Preserve existing user IDs, add `supabaseId` reference
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity Checker**: Comprehensive monitoring for orphaned records
- ‚úÖ **Migration Safety**: Automated fixes for existing OAuth users
- ‚úÖ **Prevention Measures**: Updated all documentation and rules to prevent future issues

**Impact**: Prevented potential production disaster with thousands of orphaned user records.
