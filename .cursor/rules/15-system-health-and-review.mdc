# 15: System Health & Review

## Overview

This is a living document that captures findings from architecture reviews, summarizes recent progress, and outlines a roadmap for future improvements.

## Architecture Review Findings (as of latest review)

### ✅ Strengths

- **Authentication**: Robust Supabase integration with type-safe decorators.
- **Database**: Strong data integrity with centralized, type-safe queries.
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation and user-scoped data access.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

- **Schema-Reality Mismatch**: The `user` table schema in Drizzle shows a `defaultRandom()` for the ID, but in practice, it's always overridden with the Supabase user ID. This should be corrected to avoid confusion.
- **Inconsistent User ID Types**: Some legacy tables use `varchar` for `userId` while newer ones use `uuid`. This should be standardized to `uuid`.
- **Query Optimization**: Some high-traffic queries could benefit from composite indexes.

## Summary of Recent Progress

### UI/UX Overhaul

- **Model Picker**: Redesigned from a grid to a content-first vertical list, improving scannability and mobile experience.
- **Settings Page**: Layout optimized to prioritize usage tracking and a clear upgrade CTA for free users.
- **Upgrade Flow**: Streamlined by removing the intermediate `/pricing` page, linking CTAs directly to the payment gateway to reduce friction.

### Technical Optimizations

- **API Performance**: Consolidated `/api/models` and `/api/user/settings` into a single endpoint, reducing network requests by ~50% on page load.
- **Anonymous User Handling**: Fixed bugs related to rate limiting and data persistence for anonymous users, and resolved a privacy issue where chat history could leak between sessions.
  -- **Route Simplification**: The route configuration was simplified from a three-tier (public, protected, conditional) to a two-tier (public, protected) system, reducing cognitive overhead.
