# 10: Model Selection

## Overview

The model selection system is designed for consistency, performance, and a good user experience, using a hierarchical approach to determine which AI model is active.

## Hierarchical Priority

The active model is determined by the following priority order (from highest to lowest):

1.  **Props `selectedModelId`**: An explicit prop passed to a component. This is mainly for backward compatibility.
2.  **Server Settings Model**: The user's preferred model, fetched from the database via the `/api/models` endpoint. This is the authoritative setting.
3.  **localStorage Model**: The last selected model, stored in localStorage. This provides instant UI feedback and offline persistence.
4.  **Plan-Based Default**: A fallback model determined by the user's subscription tier (`free` or `pro`).

## Implementation

The `ModelPicker` component implements this logic, using the `useModels` hook to get the server settings and `useState` with `localStorage` for the local selection.

```typescript
// components/model-picker.tsx
const { models: allModels, userSettings } = useModels();
const [localModel, setLocalModel] = useState(() =>
  safeLocalStorage.get(MODEL_SELECTION_KEY)
);
const serverModel = userSettings?.defaultModel;

const effectiveModelId = useMemo(() => {
  // ... logic to apply the priority hierarchy ...
}, [
  selectedModelId,
  serverModel,
  localModel,
  allModels,
  planBasedDefaultModel,
]);
```

When a user selects a new model:

1.  The choice is immediately written to localStorage (`setLocalModel`).
2.  A `PATCH` request is sent to `/api/user/settings` to update the database.
3.  The SWR cache for `/api/models` is revalidated to sync the server state.
